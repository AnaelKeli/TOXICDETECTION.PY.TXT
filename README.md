This project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning system capable of identifying anti-social behavior in text comments. We will leverage FastText embeddings for text representation due to their efficiency and ability to handle out-of-vocabulary words, combined with traditional machine learning classifiers: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The project will involve comprehensive data analysis, model training, evaluation using standard metrics, and a comparative analysis of the chosen classifiers, culminating in a cloud-based deployment
